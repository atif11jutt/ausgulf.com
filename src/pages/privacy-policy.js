          <p>In the event you cease to be a client of the Company, any personal information which we hold about you will be maintained in a secure manner for a period of seven years in order to comply with legislative and professional requirements, following which time the information will be destroyed.<br /><br /><strong>Accessing your information</strong><br /><br />You have a right to contact us to access the personal information we hold about you. Where you are entitled to access, the time we require to give you access will depend on the type of information requested. Generally, we will make it available to you within 30 days. We don't charge a fee, however if your request is complex we may pass on an access charge for the time we spend locating, compiling and explaining the information you ask for. If this is the case, we will give you an estimate upfront and confirm it with you before we proceed.<br /><br />In certain circumstances we are allowed to deny your request, or limit the access we provide. For example we might not provide you access to commercially sensitive information or information that may unreasonably impact upon another person's right to privacy.&nbsp; Whatever the outcome, we will write to you explaining our decision.</p>
